<h4>Jello Cube Simulation</h4>
<p>
  I developed a physics-based simulation of a Jello Cube using a mass-spring system in C++ with OpenGL for visualization. The simulation models an 8×8×8 grid of mass points connected by structural, shear, and bend springs, and incorporates damping and external force fields. I implemented both explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) integration methods to explore numerical stability in dynamic systems.

  This project taught me how to simulate soft-body dynamics using Newtonian physics and Hooke’s Law, as well as how to handle real-time collisions using a spring penalty approach. I also added extra features such as collision with an internal cube and rendered the simulation within a Cornell Box environment for better visual clarity. Through this work, I gained a deeper understanding of numerical integrators, collision response, and the challenges of real-time physical simulation in animation.
