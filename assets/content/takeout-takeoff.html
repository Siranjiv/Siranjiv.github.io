  <h3>Takeout Takeoff — Project Overview</h3>
  <p>Takeout Takeoff is a 3D platformer where you play as a cartoonish pilot soaring through low-poly worlds, catching floating meals to deliver to hungry customers while dodging birds and stormy clouds. The adventure spans multiple themed eras from the present day to medieval times to a futuristic world each adding new challenges and personality to the experience.</p>
  <p>I developed this game using Unity Engine as part of USC’s CTIN 532 Interactive Design and Production I, a course focused on understanding the complete game development pipeline. This group project gave me hands-on experience across every phase of development, from initial ideation and weekly prototyping to preproduction planning, full production, and final polish.</p>
  <p>Throughout the project, I learned to approach development from both a design and engineering perspective. Ideation taught me to test ideas quickly and iterate based on feedback. Preproduction emphasized the value of defining clear goals, building a strong vertical slice, and creating a structured plan to guide the rest of development.</p>
  <p>During full production, I worked toward major milestones, achieved feature completeness, and refined gameplay through formal playtests and collected metrics. Postproduction focused on stabilization, polish, and tightening the overall player experience.</p>
  <p>Collaboration was central to the project. Our three person team handled all game design and programming, and we partnered with Berklee College of Music for audio contributions, giving proper credit for their work. We used Perforce for version control and relied on consistent communication and healthy production practices to stay aligned throughout development.</p>
  <p>Overall, this course strengthened my ability to prototype, plan, iterate, and collaborate effectively within a small game team. It gave me a firsthand understanding of how a game evolves from an initial concept into a fully realized experience.</p>
