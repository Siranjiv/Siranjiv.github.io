<h4>Now Hiring: Shadow Government — Game Design Workshop Project</h4>
<p>
  This group project was part of USC’s Game Design Workshop course, where we created Now Hiring: Shadow Government, a party card game built around humor, debate, and storytelling. Working closely with my team, I contributed to designing game mechanics, writing card content, and conducting multiple rounds of playtesting. Through this project, I learned how to iterate based on player feedback, balance mechanics for different play styles, and design for social interaction. It also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a creative team and how to communicate design ideas clearly through prototypes and presentations.
