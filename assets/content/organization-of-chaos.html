<h4>A 2D Game with Computer Vision &amp; Voice Control</h4>
<p>
  This was the first game I ever developed an individual undergraduate research project focused on accessibility in games. Designed with the goal of supporting players with physical disabilities, the game replaced traditional input methods with voice recognition and computer vision. Built using Unity, C#, and OpenCV, it allowed players to interact using head movements and voice commands. The project not only sparked my passion for game development, but also deepened my commitment to creating inclusive and innovative play experiences.
