<h4>Inverse Kinematics with Skinning</h4>
<p>
  I developed an inverse kinematics (IK) system integrated with mesh skinning using C++ and OpenGL. Built on a forward kinematics (FK) foundation, the project enables real-time animation of a deformable character mesh by manipulating joint transformations. It supports Damped Least Squares (DLS) IK and Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) as core features.

  For added flexibility, I implemented multiple IK solvers (DLS, Pseudoinverse, and DLS_ALT) with recursive subdivision for smoother handle movements. The system also supports switching between Linear Blend and Dual Quaternion Skinning to compare deformation results. Additional features include interactive keyboard controls and frame-by-frame screenshot capture for recording animations.

  This project deepened my understanding of real-time character animation, skeletal deformation techniques, and matrix/quaternion transformationsâ€”providing hands-on experience with the mathematical and visual aspects of animation systems.
