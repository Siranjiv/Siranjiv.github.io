<h4>Custom 3D Renderer in C/C++</h4>
<p>
  I developed a custom 3D renderer using C and C++, focusing on the core elements of the graphics pipeline such as transformations, shading, and rasterization. This solo project involved implementing techniques like projection math and triangle rasterization without relying on modern graphics APIs.

  The images displayed here were all rendered by my engine, and you can click them to cycle through the outputs. This project marked a key step in building my low-level graphics skills and gave me confidence in creating rendering systems independently.
