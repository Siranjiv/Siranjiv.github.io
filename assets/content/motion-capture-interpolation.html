<h4>Motion Capture Interpolation</h4>
<p>
  I developed a motion capture interpolation system in C++ and OpenGL that processes skeleton data (ASF) and motion data (AMC) to generate smooth intermediate animations. The system supports four interpolation methods: Linear Euler, Bezier Euler (via de Casteljauâ€™s algorithm), Linear Quaternion (SLERP), and Bezier Quaternion. The results are saved to a new AMC file and visualized in an OpenGL-based mocap player, with original motion shown in red and interpolated motion in green.

  This project deepened my understanding of animation interpolation techniques, the differences between Euler angles and quaternions, and the implementation of real-time skeletal visualization. It strengthened my grasp of key concepts in motion data processing and animation systems.
