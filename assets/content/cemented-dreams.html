  <h3>Cemented Dreams — Project Overview</h3>
  <p>Cemented Dreams is an MFA Advanced Game Project (AGP) a large-scale, studio-modeled production built by a multidisciplinary team. The game takes place in a brutalist world where architecture is alive, sentient, and hungry. In this society, humans are extracted, processed, and circulated into a single substance: vodka, a fuel pure enough to power the towering structures that rule the landscape. The architecture moves when commanded. It feeds when ordered.</p>
  <p>I am currently working on this ongoing project as the Primary Engineer, contributing to graphics programming, gameplay systems, and internal tools, with a secondary role as a Game Designer. My technical work is done in Unreal Engine using C++, where I develop core systems, build tools that support the team, and implement features that bring the world’s unsettling mechanics to life.</p>
  <p>Cemented Dreams follows the structure of USC’s Advanced Games Projects: a long-form, collaborative development cycle that mirrors real industry production. Our team functions like a small studio working in sprints, presenting regular milestones, responding to publishing-style faculty reviews, and coordinating with designers, artists, writers, and audio collaborators. This environment challenges me to write maintainable code, support cross-discipline workflows, communicate clearly, and contribute meaningfully to a shared creative vision.</p>
  <p>As the project continues to evolve, I’m actively expanding the game’s technical foundation and contributing to its worldbuilding through systems design. Cemented Dreams remains in development, and I will keep updating this page as new milestones are reached.</p>
